# [Advent of Code [2024]](https://adventofcode.com/2024)
This is my first year ever doing AoC and I chose to do it in [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig)

Overall I had a ton of fun and learned a lot about the language as well as new algorithms.
The language has some areas that are a bit confusing or unintuitive but for a language not even
at its 1.0 release it was very enjoyable. I would recommend zig!

## Todo
- Day 6 takes around 30 seconds to run. Want to speed that up eventually.
